P() represents probability of it's contents P(A) is the probability that event A will occure.
Probability is reported as a value between 0 and 1(inclusive), mult by 100 for percentage
Counterpart is represented by P(A'), this is the complement event, or P of A prime or even A ^ c
Mathmatically, then,    P(A) + P(A') = 1,    or P(A) = 1 - P(A')

Conditional probability is written in the form P(A|B) and depicts the probability that A will occure given that event B has already occured ie P(Event will occure|Event has occured)

u Union (Or)

Addition Rule of Probability:
P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Law of Large numbers - Experimental probability converges with expected probability as samples are taken

Multiplication of Probability
Independent: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)
Dependent: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

Bayes' Theorem
P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A) / P(B)

Discrete Probability
E(X) = µx = mean
σ^2 of X = nΣ/i=1(Xi - µ)^2 *P(Xi)
with mean and variance I can calculate values like coinflips above 3.7 or between 1and 2.5 times landing heads even with descrete variables.

Shifting a dataset
mean = mean + k
median = median + k
mode = mode + k
range, IQR, σ all unchanged by shifting

Scaling a dataset
All attributes are multiplied by k (5, 5, 6) becomes (10, 10, 6) and std iqr range blah blah bllah... all multiplied by 2

COMBINATIONS OF_RANDOM_VIARIABLES
Populations:
[1,2,2,3]
[2,3,5,6]
both have N = 4 (population)
1+2+2+3 = 8/N = µ = 2
µ =(1-2)^2.2and2.(3-2)^2 / N = 2/4 = 1/2
σ = µ^1/2 = 2^.5

(Must be independent, converted to matching units (dollars, hours...))
Combination: Sum = X+Y Dif = X-Y
Mean       µ sum = µx+µy µ dif = µx-µy
var        σ^2 sum and dif = σx^2 + σy^2 (variance is preserved regardless of operation)

The σ must be discovered by taking the square root of the variance
