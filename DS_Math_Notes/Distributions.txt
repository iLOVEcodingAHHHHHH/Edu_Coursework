Probability Mass Function (PMF): Probability of specific value for discrete variable.

f(x) = P[X=x]

rules...
X is discrete random variable
0<=P(Xi)<=1 (all probabilities between 0 and 1)
P(X) = 1 (sum of probabilities)

x is specific value

Uniform dist means all P(X) are level or equal (dice roll)

f(x) = P[X=x] = P[X=CEO] (obvious 1%, example for formulation)


Probability Density Function (PDF)

P(a<=x<=b)=⌠

rules
f(x) >0 (no negative x permitted)
⌠1/0 f(x) dx = 1 (is calc but rule is integral must = 1)

continous random variable

PDF used for interval ranges, within 60-120 seconds
P[1<X<2] = ⌠b/a f(x) dx
