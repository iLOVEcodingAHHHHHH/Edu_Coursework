    "### What is Apache Arrow?\n",
    "Apache Arrow is an open source cross-language project to store tabular data in-memory. Apache Arrow is both:\n",
    "- a specification for how data should be represented in memory\n",
    "- a set of libraries in different languages that implement that specification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does `Polars` use `Apache Arrow`?\n",
    "The Apache Arrow project developed when it became clear that Numpy arrays - designed for scientific computing - are not the optimal data store for tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrow allows for:\n",
    "- a standardised way of representing data across packages and languages\n",
    "- sharing data without copying between processes (known as \"zero-copy\")\n",
    "- faster vectorised calculations\n",
    "- working with larger-than-memory data in chunks\n",
    "- consistent representation of missing data\n",
    "- built-in support for string data\n",
    "- built-in support for nested data\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Polars can process data more quickly and with less memory usage because of Arrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the downsides of `Apache Arrow`?\n",
    "The design of Arrow is optimised for operations on one-dimensional columns, whereas the design of Numpy is optimised for operations on multi-dimensional arrays. This tradeoff means some kinds of operations will be slower with Arrow data compared to Numpy:\n",
    "- transposing a dataframe\n",
    "- doing matrix multiplication/linear algebra on a `dataframe`\n",
    "\n",
    "For this kind of use case - where calculations require accessing data by row and column - it may be faster to convert to a Numpy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what is the relationship between a Polars `DataFrame` and Arrow data?\n",
    "A Polars `DataFrame` holds references to an Arrow Table which holds references to Arrow Arrays. We can think of a Polars `DataFrame` being a lightweight object that points to the lightweight Arrow Table which points to the heavyweight Arrow Arrays (heavyweight because they hold the actual data). \n",
